This project aims to generate Monet-style paintings using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).
The challenge is part of a Kaggle competition where I need to:
- Generate 7,000-10,000 Monet-style images
- Images must be 256x256 pixels in RGB format
- Evaluation is done using MiFID score (Modified Fréchet Inception Distance)
